Salamandors Regenerate almost everything
blastema : , a mass of undifferentiated cells that has the capability to develop into an organ or an appendage.
This blastema if humans have may make them more likely to develop cancer

Several companies and research institutions are actively involved in the field of human regeneration and regenerative medicine. Here are some notable examples:

Organovo: Specializes in 3D bioprinting technology to create human tissues for medical research and therapeutic applications.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: Focuses on biopharmaceuticals for treating serious medical conditions, including therapies aimed at regenerating damaged tissues.

United Therapeutics: Works on regenerative medicine solutions, including organ manufacturing and tissue engineering for lung transplantation.

Humacyte: Develops human acellular vessels (HAVs) for vascular repair and replacement, using bioengineered tissues.

Athersys: Focuses on stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine, particularly for neurological and inflammatory conditions.

Bluebird Bio: Specializes in gene therapy and gene editing technologies for treating genetic diseases, some of which involve regenerative approaches.

Celularity: Uses placental-derived cells for therapeutic applications in immuno-oncology and regenerative medicine.

Cellular Dynamics International (a Fujifilm Company): Produces human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated cells for research and therapeutic purposes.

Cynata Therapeutics: Develops mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for various medical indications, including immune disorders and tissue regeneration.

Osiris Therapeutics: Focuses on stem cell therapies for wound healing, bone regeneration, and inflammatory diseases.
